				<h2>In This Book...</h2>

			<div class="idd-body readable-text">
				<p>The Book of Psalms is called '<i>sephar tallim</i>' in Hebrew, meaning 'book of praises'. In Greek it was translated as '<i>psalmoi</i>', which means 'the twang of the strings of a musical instrument'. There are 150 psalms, and this version follows the numbering found in the Latin vulgate Bible of the Middle Ages. These Psalms were believed to be written by King David, though others believe there were multiple authors or simply use the title 'Psalmist'.
				<br><br>In keeping with Medieval inspiration, this edition is formatted as it would have been for all Christians during the first 1000 years of the religion. That is, each psalm is presented as a single text without verse numbering, but with psalm numbering in numerals, as they were written before Stephen Langton, Archbishop of Canterbury, introduced chapter numbering to the Bible in the 1200s. Monks in their monasteries would recite aloud or sing each all 150 psalms each day as a form of prayer.
